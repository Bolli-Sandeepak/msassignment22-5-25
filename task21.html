    <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>

    <p>
        HTML (<em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>) is used to create documents on the 
        <u>World Wide Web</u>. 
        <em>It is simply a collection of certain key words called "Tags" that are helpful in writing 
        the document to be displayed using a browser on Internet.</em> 
        HTML was developed by <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> in 1992.
